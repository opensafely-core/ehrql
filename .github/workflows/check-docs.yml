      # This check becomes somewhat redundant if we fix up the Cloudflare Pages preview
      # to work with Dependabot, because the deployment will also do the build.
      # See https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/issues/930 which documents this problem.
      #
      # However, for any PR, Cloudflare Pages previews sometimes fail for mysterious reasons,
      # and this requires logging into Cloudflare Pages to inspect.
      # So it is perhaps useful to distinguish a Cloudflare failure with an actual issue.
