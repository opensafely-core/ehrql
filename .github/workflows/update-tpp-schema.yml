          body: |
            This PR was created by the `update-tpp-schema.yml` file. It means that something about the TPP schema or data dictionary has changed.

            If `tpp_categorical_columns.csv` has changed then we may need to update any tables that have the values hard-coded.

            If `tpp_decision_support_reference.csv` has changed then we may need to update parts of the `decision_support_values` table. E.g.
             - if there is a new algorithm, or a new version of an existing algorithm, we may want to expose it
             - if an existing algorithm's name has changed we may need to update our code
