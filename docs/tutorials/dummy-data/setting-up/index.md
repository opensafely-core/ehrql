## Creating a GitHub repository and Codespace.

We will use a new GitHub repository for this tutorial, cloned from the standard OpenSAFELY research template.

Follow the instructions from the OpenSAFELY tutorial to [create a new repository][2] and then
[create a GitHub codespace][3].

If you have any problems, get in touch with the OpenSAFELY tech team via your copilot, or by emailing tech@opensafely.org.
