This tutorial provides practical steps for learning about ehrQL's dummy data.


You will work through using ehrQL to:

* understand the dummy data options available natively in ehrQL
* use ehrQL to generate custom dummy tables
* use ehrQL's `show` feature to test ehrQL code against your dummy tables

The tutorial is interactive.
You will get the most out of it if you run the code yourself, and do experiments by changing the code and trying to explain what you see.

The ehrQL code that we'll look at in this tutorial is quite simple, however, it is assumed that you are not *completely* new to ehrQL. We would recommend following the [Introduction to ehrQL tutorial](../introduction-to-ehrql/index.md) to learn more
about ehrQL itself.

You can also find a tutorial for writing an OpenSAFELY study in our [Getting started][1] guide.

Get started with [Setting up](./setting-up/index.md).
