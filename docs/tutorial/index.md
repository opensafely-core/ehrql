This tutorial provides practical steps for learning ehrQL.

![An XKCD cartoon](xkcd-2582.png)

You will work through using ehrQL to:

* identify patients who should be on the QOF register for diabetes, and
* categorise patients on the register according to various QOF business rules.

??? tip "What's QOF?"
    QOF is the [Quality and Outcomes Framework][1].
    It is an incentive programme for GP practices.
    To receive payment, GPs must keep registers of patients with various conditions, and demonstrate that they are providing care according to business rules.

    An example from the diabetes business rules (found [here][2]) would be that patients with a new diagnosis of diabetes should be referred to a structured education programme within nine months of diagnosis.

The tutorial is interactive.
You will get the most out of it if you run the code yourself, and do experiments by changing the code and trying to explain what you see.

At the end of the tutorial there will be a quiz.

You can find a tutorial for writing an OpenSAFELY study in our [Getting started][3] guide.

Get started with [Setting up](./setting-up/index.md).
