"""
All databases have limits and Hypothesis finds it quite easy to generate examples which
exceed these limts e.g. dates which extended beyond the range of representable dates or
queries which are so deeply nested they cause the query planner to overflow.

These aren't the kinds of problem we're interested in here: we're trying to find queries
of the kind a user might plausibly write which either trigger an error or return
incorrect results in a particular engine.

So below we capture the kinds of error we're going to ignore for the purposes of
generative testing.
