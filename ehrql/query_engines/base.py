        instead which yields a flat sequence of rows, with tables separated by the

        two columns (a numerator and denominator column) and grouping by one or more columns.

        Override this method to do the things necessary to generate query code and
        execute it against a particular backend.

        Emitting results in a flat sequence like this with separators between the tables
        ends up making the query code _much_ easier to reason about because everything
        happens in a clear linear sequence rather than inside nested generators. This
