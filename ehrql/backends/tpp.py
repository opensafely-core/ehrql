    [TPP](https://tpp-uk.com/) are the developers and operators of the
    [SystmOne](https://tpp-uk.com/products/) EHR platform. The ehrQL TPP backend
    provides access to primary care data from SystmOne, plus data linked from other
    sources.

    ### Patients included in the TPP backend

    SystmOne is a primary care clinical information system
    used by roughly one third of GP practices in England,
    with records for approximately 44% of the English population.

    Only patients with a full GMS (General Medical Services) registration are included.

    We have registration history for:

    * all patients currently registered at a TPP practice
    * all patients registered at a TPP practice any time from 1 Jan 2009 onwards:
        * who have since de-registered
        * who have since died

    A patient can be registered with zero, one, or more than one practices at a given
    time. For instance, students are often registered with a practice at home and a
    practice at university.

    !!! warning
        Refer to the [discussion of selecting populations for studies](../explanation/selecting-populations-for-study.md).
