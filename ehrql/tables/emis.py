    ### Recording of death in primary care

    Dates of death appear in two places in the data made available via OpenSAFELY: the
    primary care record, and the death certificate data supplied by the ONS.

    ONS death data are considered the gold standard for identifying patient death in
    England because they are based on the MCCDs (Medical Certificate of Cause of Death)
    which the last attending doctor has a statutory duty to complete.

    While there is generally a lag between the death being recorded in ONS data and it
    appearing in the primary care record, the coverage of recorded death is almost
    complete and the date of death is usually reliable when it appears. There is also a
    lag in ONS death recording (see [`ons_deaths`](#ons_deaths) below for more detail).
    You can find out more about the accuracy of date of death recording in primary care
    in:

    > Gallagher, A. M., Dedman, D., Padmanabhan, S., Leufkens, H. G. M. & de Vries, F 2019. The accuracy of date of death recording in the Clinical
    > Practice Research Datalink GOLD database in England compared with the Office for National Statistics death registrations.
    > Pharmacoepidemiol. Drug Saf. 28, 563–569.
    > <https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.4747>

    By contrast, _cause_ of death is often not accurate in the primary care record so we
    don't make it available to query here.
