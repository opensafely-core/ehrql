    ### Recording of death in primary care

    In England, it is the statutory duty of the doctor who had attended in the last
    illness to complete a medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD). ONS death data
    are considered the gold standard for identifying patient deaths because they are
    based on these MCCDs.

    There is generally a lag between the death being recorded in ONS data and it
    appearing in the primary care record, but the coverage or recorded death is almost
    complete and the date of death is usually reliable when it appears. There is
    also a lag in ONS death recording (see [`ons_deaths`](core.md#ons_deaths)
    for more detail). You can find out more about the accuracy of date of death
    recording in primary care in:

    > Practice Research Datalink GOLD database in England compared with the Office for National Statistics death registrations.
