    Registered deaths

    Date and cause of death based on information recorded when deaths are
    certified and registered in England and Wales from February 2019 onwards.
    The data provider is the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

    This table includes the underlying cause of death and up to 15 medical conditions mentioned on the death certificate.
    These codes (`cause_of_death_01` to `cause_of_death_15`) are not ordered meaningfully.

    More information about this table can be found in following documents provided by the ONS:

    - [Information collected at death registration](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatisticsjuly2017#information-collected-at-death-registration)
    - [User guide to mortality statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatisticsjuly2017)
    - [How death registrations are recorded and stored by ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/howdeathregistrationsarerecordedandstoredbyons)

    In the associated database table a small number of patients have multiple registered deaths.
    This table contains all registered deaths.
    The `ehrql.tables.core.ons_deaths` table contains the earliest registered death.

    !!! tip
        To return one row per patient from `ehrql.tables.raw.core.ons_deaths`,
        for example the latest registered death, you can use:

        ```py
        ons_deaths.sort_by(ons_deaths.date).last_for_patient()
        ```
