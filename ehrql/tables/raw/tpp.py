    * **Data provider** NHS England
    * **Participation / Coverage** Inpatients and outpatients treated with antivirals/nMABs for COVID-19 in England
    * **Provenance** Data sourced largely from BlueTeq system (forms completed by clinicians)
    * **Update frequency in OpenSAFELY** Approximately weekly
    * **Delay between event occurring and event appearing in OpenSAFELY** Approximately 2-9 days
    * **Collected information** Treatment start date; therapeutic intervention; COVID indication, current status, risk group, region


    **Overview**

    Antivirals and neutralising monoclonal antibodies (nMABs) for COVID-19 can be
    administered in inpatient setting or, for outpatients, in COVID Medicine Delivery
    Units (CMDUs) specifically set up for this purpose. For patients considered for
    these treatments, clinicians submit completed forms to NHS England. Each row
    represents one completed form for one course of treatment. Data received by
    OpenSAFELY currently covers patients who were approved for treatment. The patient
    may or may not have actually received the treatment or completed the course (but we
    assume that they usually do). They may have another form completed for another
    treatment, either because it was decided to give them a different treatment, or for
    some other reason. They may in theory also have another form completed some months
    later for another instance of infection.

    Treatment dates may be in the past or future at the point when the form is
    submitted.

    Note that this dataset contains some **duplicate** rows – some full duplicates and
    some partial duplicates.
