            The codes are arranged in clusters separated by commas, with each cluster
            separated by two pipe characters (`||`). These separators may or may not be
            surrounded by spaces. For example:

                ||E119 ,J849 ,K869 ,M069 ,Z824 ,Z867 ||I801 ,I802 ,N179 ,N183

            A hospital "spell" is made up of 1 or more "episodes". The `||` is the separator
            between episodes. I.e. the example above is a spell of two episodes with 6
            diagnosis codes recorded in the first episode, and 4 recorded in the second.

            ```python
            apcs.where(apcs.all_diagnoses.contains("N171"))
            ```

            You can take advantage of the hierarchical structure of ICD-10 by searching
            the just the prefix of a code. For example to match all N17 (Acute renal
            failure) codes you could use:

            So if you were looking for any of a list of ICD10 codes called `icd10_diagnosis_codes` you
            could do:
            ```python

        There are also duplicate events in the table that we need to better understand.

        As a consequence, if you try to use the appointment table, you will see warnings
        when running your code locally, and failures when the GitHub action tests your
        code. If you need access to the appointments data, please speak to your
        OpenSAFELY co-pilot. We will be considering projects on a case by case basis
        until it can enter the normal stable pool of data.

        A **very important** caveat for this data: there are some circumstances where
        historical appointment records will be incomplete, for example when a patient
        moves from a practice using a different EHR provider, or when a practice changes
        EHR provider. If your study could be negatively affected by such missing data,
        it may be important to use the
        [`practice_registrations.spanning_with_systmone()`](#practice_registrations.spanning_with_systmone)
        method to identify patients which have a suitably continuous practice
        registration during the study period.

    Some further investigation of the appointments data in TPP can be found in [this
    King's fund report](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2016/05/crisis-general-practice).

    And you can find out more about [the associated database table][appointments_5] in the [short data report][appointments_1].
    It shows:

    * Date ranges for `booked_date`, `start_date`, and `seen_date`
    * Row counts by month for `booked_date` and `start_date`
    * The distribution of lead times (`start_date - booked_date`)
    * Row counts for each value of `status`

    To view it, you will need a login for OpenSAFELY Jobs and the Project Collaborator
    or Project Developer role for the [project][appointments_4]. The
    [workspace][appointments_2] shows when the code that comprises the report was run;
    the code itself is in the [appointments-short-data-report][appointments_3]
    repository on GitHub.

    #### Appointments vs Consultations

    "Consultation" is a very broad concept in SystmOne. It covers the things you might
    expect, like a patient sitting down in front of a GP. But it also covers things like
    some new pathology results arriving. There is no direct, explicit relationship
    between an appointment and a consultation; but if an appointment results in any form
    of recorded patient interaction then a corresponding consultation will be created.

    The only way to link appointments and consultation is via the date they happened.
    For instance, given some appointments you can find events which occurred on the same
    day using:
    ```python
    clinical_events.where(clinical_events.date.is_in(appointments.date))
    ```

    !!! tip
        Querying this table is similar to using Cohort Extractor's
        `patients.with_gp_consultations` function. However, that function filters by
        the status of the appointment. To achieve a similar result with this table:

        ```py
        appointments.where(
            appointments.status.is_in([
                "Arrived",
                "In Progress",
                "Finished",
                "Visit",
                "Waiting",
                "Patient Walked Out",
            ])
        )
        ```

    **Overview**

    Antivirals and neutralising monoclonal antibodies (nMABs) for COVID-19 can be
    administered in inpatient setting or, for outpatients, in COVID Medicine Delivery
    Units (CMDUs) specifically set up for this purpose. For patients considered for
    these treatments, clinicians submit completed forms to NHS England. Each row
    represents one completed form for one course of treatment. Data received by
    OpenSAFELY currently covers patients who were approved for treatment. The patient
    may or may not have actually received the treatment or completed the course (but we
    assume that they usually do). They may have another form completed for another
    treatment, either because it was decided to give them a different treatment, or for
    some other reason. They may in theory also have another form completed some months
    later for another instance of infection.

    Treatment dates may be in the past or future at the point when the form is
    submitted.

    Note that this dataset may contain **duplicate** rows – full duplicates are removed
    but there may remain some partial duplicates.

    for data transfer through the
    [Electronic Prescription Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service/)
    in which data passes from the prescriber to the pharmacy for dispensing.

    Medications are coded using
    [dm+d codes](https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2019/08/what-is-the-dm-d-the-nhs-dictionary-of-medicines-and-devices/).
    The medications table is structured similarly to the [clinical_events](#clinical_events)
    table, and each row in the table is made up of a patient identifier, an event (dm+d)
    code, and an event date. For this table, the event refers to the issue of a medication
    (coded as a dm+d code), and the event date, the date the prescription was issued.

    ### Factors to consider when using medications data

    Depending on the specific area of research, you may wish to exclude medications
    in particular periods. For example, in order to ensure medication data is stable
    following a change of practice, you may want to exclude patients for a period after
    the start of their practice registration . You may also want to
    exclude medications for patients for a period prior to their leaving a practice.
    Alternatively, for research looking at a specific period of
    interest, you may simply want to ensure that all included patients were registered
    at a single practice for a minimum time prior to the study period, and were
    registered at the same practice for the duration of the study period.

    Examples of using ehrQL to calculation such periods can be found in the documentation
    on how to
    [use ehrQL to answer specific questions using the medications table](../../how-to/examples.md#clinical-events)

    Registered deaths

    Date and cause of death based on information recorded when deaths are
    certified and registered in England and Wales from February 2019 onwards.
    The data provider is the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
    This table is updated approximately weekly in OpenSAFELY.

    This table includes the underlying cause of death and up to 15 medical conditions
    mentioned on the death certificate.  These codes (`cause_of_death_01` to
    `cause_of_death_15`) are not ordered meaningfully.

    More information about this table can be found in following documents provided by the ONS:

    - [Information collected at death registration](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatisticsjuly2017#information-collected-at-death-registration)

    - [How death registrations are recorded and stored by ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/howdeathregistrationsarerecordedandstoredbyons)

    In the associated database table [ONS_Deaths](https://reports.opensafely.org/reports/opensafely-tpp-database-schema/#ONS_Deaths),
    a small number of patients have multiple registered deaths.
    This table contains the earliest registered death.
    The `ehrql.tables.raw.core.ons_deaths` table contains all registered deaths.

    !!! warning
        There is also a lag in ONS death recording caused amongst other things by things
        like autopsies and inquests delaying reporting on cause of death. This is

    Patients referred for non-emergency consultant-led treatment are on RTT pathways.
    The "clock start" date is the date of the first referral that starts the pathway.
