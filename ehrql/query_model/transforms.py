"""
Apply modifications to the query graph which make it easier to work with or allow us to
generate more efficient SQL.

This involves adding new kinds of nodes to the query model. However we deliberately
define these nodes outside of the core query_model module because we're trying to
maintain separation of three types of concern:

    1. capturing the semantics of the query (which is the query model's job);
    2. worrying about expressiveness and ease of use (which is ehrQL's job);
    3. worrying about efficient execution (which is the query engines' job).

The transformations applied here are all about efficient execution, and therefore we
want to keep them separate from the core query model classes.

    Frames are sorted in order to then pick the first or last row for a patient. Multiple sorts
    may be applied to give the desired results. Once a single row has been picked, one or more
    columns are then selected.

    This results in a subgraph of QM objects like this:

    SelectColumn(A) -+
                     |
    SelectColumn(B) -+-> PickOneRowPerPatient -> Sort(A) -> Sort(B) -> SelectTable
                     |
    SelectColumn(C) -+

    There are two transformations that we need to carry out on this stack.

    1. We annotate PickOneRowPerPatient with the columns that are going to be selected from it, in
       order to allow us to generate the appropriate query more easily.
    2. Add sorts so that we have one for each column that will be selected, in order to ensure that
       the sort order (and hence the values of the selected columns) is deterministic.

    For the example above the resulting subgraph would be:

    SelectColumn(A) -+
                     |
    SelectColumn(B) -+-> PickOneRowPerPatientWithColumns -> Sort(A) -> Sort(B) -> Sort(C) -> SelectTable
                     |
    SelectColumn(C) -+

    Some notes on the additional sorts are in order.

    * A potential lack of determinism in sort order creeps in when a patient has multiple rows with
      the same value of the column(s) being sorted on. In this case some databases may give different
      orders on different runs of the same query against the same data.
    * When this lack of determinism exists, and we select a column that has not been sorted on, the
      value returned may change between runs.
    * We add sorts only for columns that don't already have them. Duplicate sorts wouldn't cause a
      problem, but are conceptually messy and might have a small performance impact.
    * We add the sorts below the existing ones so that they have lower priority and are only used to
      break any ties in the user-specified sorts.
    * When considering the existing sorts we only attend to those that sort directly on selected
      columns, not on expressions derived from a column. Such expressions may not be injective and so
      may not be sufficient to fully determine the order. As above, duplicates are not a problem.
    * We introduce an arbitrary order for the additional sorts (lexically by column name) to ensure
      that their order itself is deterministic.
