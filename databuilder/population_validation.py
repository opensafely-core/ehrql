    # We exclude population definitions which evaluate as True when all their inputs are
    # NULL. Here's why.
    #
    # A population definition is a boolean series which is True for all patients who
    # should be included in the population. In SQL terms, you can think of a boolean
    # series as a function, or expression, which takes a row of patient values
    # (potentially drawn from many different tables) and returns True, False or NULL.
    #
    # It is possible to construct definitions which take the value True when all their
    # inputs are NULL. The most trivial example is:
    #
    #   Value(True)
    #
    # i.e. always, unconditionally True for everyone. This might seem silly, but we used
    # to think it was a convenient way to say "just give me all the patients" in test
    # cases.
    #
    # A slightly less trivial example is:
    #
    #   Function.Not(AggregateByPatient.Exists(SelectTable("ons_deaths")))
    #
    # i.e. give me all patients for whom we do not have a death record from ONS. Here
    # the `Exists` aggregation returns False when there is no corresponding row for the
    # patient in the `ons_deaths` table, and the `Not` function transforms that value
    # into True.
    #
    # In both these cases, the expression can be True when evaluated on patients which
    # do not exist in any of the tables referenced by the expression itself. This means
    # that the population we end up with is sensitive to the "universe" of patients we
    # decide to feed in. And some natural-sounding universes, e.g. the union of all
    # patients featuring anywhere in the database, are awkward and expensive to compute.
    #
    # Excluding such definitions means that the minimum set of patients needed to
    # evalute the expression (all patients featuring in tables referenced in the
    # expression) gives the same results as with any larger set. So the question of
    # exactly how we define the patient "universe" goes away.
    #
    # As well as simplifying the implementation there are also good scientific reasons
    # to exclude these kinds of population definitions: a well constructed study should
    # start with a positively defined population (e.g. all patients registered with a
    # practice as of a certain date) from which some patients are then excluded. A
    # population definition like "all patients who have not died" doesn't unambiguously
    # define a universe of patients and so should not be allowed even if we could
    # reliably interpret it.
    #
    # To determine whether a population definition meets this criterion we walk the tree
    # of query model nodes and for each operation which would normally involve fetching
    # data we substitute the result of that operation when given no data (this is often,
    # but not always, NULL). The end result of the process will be either True, False or
    # NULL. It is definitions which return True here that we reject.
