# BASIC QUERY MODEL TYPES
#
# The Query Model consists of operations on "frames" and "series". A frame is a table-like
# thing that has rows and columns, and a series is a column-like thing that contains a
# sequence of values. Frames can be created from SQL tables, and then various filtering,
# transformation and sorting operations can be applied to produce new frames. Likewise,
# a series can be created from a SQL column and then transformed and combined with
# others to produce new series.
#
# Central to the Query Model design is that these frames and series have an additional
# property called their "dimension": do they contain at most one row per patient, or
# might they contain many rows?

def validate_input_domains(node):
    # The domain of a Frame or Series can be thought of as the set of its primary keys.
    # This determines which other Frames or Series it can be validly composed with. The
    # rules we want to enforce are:
    #
    #  * One-row-per-patient data can be composed with anything: by design every table
    #    has a patient_id column and so data defined purely in terms of patient_id
    #    can be joined with anything.
    #
    #  * Many-rows-per-patient data drawn from different tables can never be combined
    #    — at least, not until we add an explicit JOIN operation.
    #
    #  * Many-rows-per-patient series data drawn from a single underlying table can be
    #    combined if they have had the same set of filters applied to them. That is, it's
    #    legal to combine two series derived from `Table A -> Filter B`, but not a series
    #    derived from `Table A -> Filter B -> Filter C` with one derived from
    #    `Table A -> Filter B`. There's never a need to use such constructions and they
    #    will almost always be the result of user error. It's better to reject them
    #    immediately than give the user unexpected results at query time.
    #
    #    As an example, we reject this erhQL construction because the per-patient
    #    cardinality of the first argument to `+` may be lower than that of the second:
    #
    #        e.take(e.b).i + e.i
    #
    # * Many-rows-per-patient frames can be combined with many-rows-per-patient series
    #   derived from the same underlying table, as long as any filters applied to each
    #   one are identical or make the series a "parent" of the frame. That is, it's legal
    #   to combine `Table A -> Filter B -> Filter C` and a series derived from
    #   `Table A -> Filter B`. But it's not legal to combine `Table A -> Filter D` and a
    #   series derived from `Table A -> Filter E`. Combination of this nature takes place
    #   with the Filter and Sort operations.
    #
    #   That means that filters and sorts can be expressed tersely in ehrQL, like this:
    #
    #       events.filter(events.code == "foo").filter(events.date >= start_date)
    #
    # We enforce this by modelling domains as a hierarchy. At the root is the patient
    # domain, each table has an unique domain descending from this, and each filter
    # operation creates a new domain descending from the domain of its source.
    #
    # A valid series combination operation is one where the non-patient domains are
    # identical. A valid filter or sort operation is one where the domains of its series
    # input's domain is an ancestor of its frame input's domain.
