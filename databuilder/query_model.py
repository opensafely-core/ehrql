# BASIC QUERY MODEL TYPES
#
# The Query Model consists of operations on "frames" and "series". A frame is a table-like
# thing that has rows and columns, and a series is a column-like thing that contains a
# sequence of values. Frames can be created from SQL tables, and then various filtering,
# transformation and sorting operations can be applied to produce new frames. Likewise,
# a series can be created from a SQL column and then transformed and combined with
# others to produce new series.
#
# Central to the Query Model design is that these frames and series have an additional
# property called their "dimension": do they contain at most one row per patient, or
# might they contain many rows?
